"As a software development team, we want to implement a continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipeline."

Acceptance Criteria:

The CI/CD pipeline should be integrated with the source code repository, such as GitHub, Bitbucket, or GitLab.
The pipeline should automatically build and test the code upon every commit or pull request.
The pipeline should include a staging environment for developers to test and review changes before deploying to production.
The pipeline should be able to deploy the code to production automatically or with manual approval, depending on the team's preference.
The pipeline should notify team members of any build or deployment failures and provide logs for debugging purposes.
The pipeline should be documented and easy to understand for new team members who join the project.
The pipeline should incorporate security and compliance measures, such as vulnerability scanning and code analysis, to ensure the deployed code is secure and meets industry standards.
