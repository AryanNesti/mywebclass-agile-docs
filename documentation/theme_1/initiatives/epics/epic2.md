# Implementation of new Features

Description: As a social media platform, we want to implement a feature for users to schedule posts in advance.

Goals:

Increase user engagement by enabling them to post at optimal times
Improve user experience by reducing the need for users to manually post at specific times
Increase the efficiency of content creation and management for businesses and influencers
User Stories:

As a user, I want to be able to schedule posts in advance so that I can post at optimal times without having to be online.
As a user, I want to be able to edit scheduled posts so that I can make changes before they are published.
As a business, I want to be able to schedule multiple posts in advance so that I can efficiently manage my content and save time.
Dependencies:

Integration with social media platform API
Access to data analytics tools to determine optimal posting times
Risks:

Integration with social media platform API may encounter technical difficulties
Difficulty in accurately determining optimal posting times may hinder the success of the feature
Potential for user confusion or frustration if the scheduling process is not user-friendly or if scheduled posts do not publish correctly
Estimated Effort: 3-4 months of development, testing, and deployment

Business Value: The ability to schedule posts in advance will improve the user experience, increase engagement, and provide businesses and influencers with a more efficient content creation and management process.

Priority: High priority as scheduling posts in advance is a highly requested feature by users and can have significant benefits for both users and businesses on the platform.
