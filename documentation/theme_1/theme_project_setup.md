# Theme 1.0: Project Setup

## Overview

Our objective is to establish a highly visible web presence using lean and agile
principles to quickly and effectively develop a strong foundation for our web
project. By completing the initiatives outlined in this theme, we can establish
a solid foundation that ensures our web page meets our business requirements
throughout the life of the project, setting us up for long-term success.

To achieve our objective, we will implement a DevOps process to streamline the development,
testing, and deployment of the new website. Additionally, ensure that our website satisfies the necessary technical and legal requirements for implementing Google Analytics and that we are appropriately listed in search engines by implementing basic on-page SEO requirements. Establishing a highly visible web presence is crucial for businesses today, as it helps to attract and retain customers, build brand recognition, and drive sales. To achieve this objective, our team is committed to utilizing lean and agile principles, which emphasize efficiency, flexibility, and continuous improvement.

Through the initiatives outlined in this theme, we aim to develop a strong foundation for our web project that aligns with our business requirements. This includes creating a responsive design that works well across multiple devices, optimizing page load times to provide a seamless user experience, and implementing a user-friendly interface that makes it easy for visitors to navigate our site.

By prioritizing these initiatives and leveraging the power of lean and agile principles, we can quickly and effectively build a web presence that meets the needs of our customers and supports our business goals.
